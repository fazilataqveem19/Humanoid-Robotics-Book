## Prompt

yes use sp.specify

## Response snapshot

I have created the feature specification for the Humanoid Robotics Book.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The feature specification for the book has been created at `specs/humanoid-robotics-book/spec.md`. This will guide the development of the book.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: 
  - `specs/humanoid-robotics-book/spec.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.plan`
- 🧠 Reflection: The user's detailed initial prompt was very helpful in creating a comprehensive specification. Mapping the user's free-form text to the structured `spec-template.md` was a key step.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `sp.specify` command was not explicitly defined, so I had to infer its functionality.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): A more clearly defined `sp.specify` command would be helpful.
