## Prompt

System: Please continue.

## Response snapshot

I have written the content for the Appendices section.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The `docs/appendices.md` file has been populated with content for the Appendices section, completing all content for the book.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: 
  - `docs/appendices.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: The book content is now complete. The next step would be to ensure the Docusaurus configuration is correct and build the book.
- 🧠 Reflection: A comprehensive appendix adds significant value to a technical book, providing quick references and setup guides.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
