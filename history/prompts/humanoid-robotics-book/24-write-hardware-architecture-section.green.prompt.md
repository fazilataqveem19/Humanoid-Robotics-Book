## Prompt

System: Please continue.

## Response snapshot

I have written the content for the Hardware Architecture section.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The `docs/hardware-architecture.md` file has been populated with content describing the hardware architecture of humanoid robots.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: 
  - `docs/hardware-architecture.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: Start writing content for `appendices.md`.
- 🧠 Reflection: This section effectively bridges the gap between software-focused modules and the physical reality of robots.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Start writing the content for `docs/appendices.md`.
