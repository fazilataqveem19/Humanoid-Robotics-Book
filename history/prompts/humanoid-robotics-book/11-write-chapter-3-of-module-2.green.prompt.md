## Prompt

System: Please continue.

## Response snapshot

I have written the content for the third chapter of Module 2.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The `docs/module-2/module2-chapter3.md` file has been populated with the content for the third chapter of Module 2, explaining how to simulate a robot in Gazebo.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: 
  - `docs/module-2/module2-chapter3.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: Start writing the content for the fourth chapter of Module 2.
- 🧠 Reflection: Providing a launch file example is a good way to show the user how to put all the pieces together and actually run the simulation.

- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Start writing the content for `docs/module-2/module2-chapter4.md`.
