# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Vision-Language-Action Models

This chapter introduces the foundational concepts of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which enable robots to understand and interact with the world through natural language and visual perception. We will explore how these models bridge the gap between human instructions and robotic execution.

### Topics Covered:
- The convergence of computer vision, natural language processing, and robot control
- Key components of VLA architectures (e.g., visual encoders, language models, action decoders)
- The motivation for VLA models in complex human-robot interaction scenarios
- Overview of current research trends and applications

This introduction will set the stage for a deeper dive into the technical details and practical applications of VLA models in the subsequent chapters.
