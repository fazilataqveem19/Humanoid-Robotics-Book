# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Chapter 3: Language Understanding and Generation for Robotics

This chapter explores the role of natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) within Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotics. We will investigate how robots interpret human commands and generate appropriate responses or internal representations for action.

### Topics Covered:
- Grounded language learning: connecting words to visual and physical concepts
- Robotic dialog systems: enabling natural conversation with robots
- Task planning from natural language instructions
- Challenges in ambiguity and context understanding in robotic language processing
- Techniques for generating informative and actionable language from robotic observations

By understanding these concepts, you will be able to design VLA models that can effectively communicate with and be commanded by humans in complex environments.
