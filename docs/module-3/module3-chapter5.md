# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Chapter 5: Deploying and Optimizing AI Models on Isaac

This chapter focuses on the deployment and optimization of AI models within the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem. We will cover best practices for taking trained models from development to a real-time robotic application, emphasizing performance and efficiency.

### Topics Covered:
- Integrating AI models (e.g., from TensorFlow, PyTorch) with Isaac SDK
- Model optimization techniques for embedded systems
- Real-time inference and performance tuning
- Debugging and profiling AI applications in Isaac
- Case studies of AI deployment in humanoid robotics

This chapter will equip you with the knowledge to bridge the gap between theoretical AI models and their practical application on robotic platforms using NVIDIA Isaac.
