# Research Plan and Findings

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

During the planning phase, no "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items were identified within the technical context. This implies that the initial understanding of the project's technical landscape is sufficiently clear to proceed.

However, research will be an ongoing and integral part of the content creation process for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book." This will involve:

-   **Literature Review**: Continuous review of academic papers, industry reports, and publications related to ROS 2, Digital Twins, NVIDIA Isaac, and VLA models.
-   **Official Documentation**: Thorough examination of official documentation for all toolchains and frameworks used (ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, Docusaurus).
-   **Hardware Specifications**: Consulting specifications for referenced hardware (Workstations, Jetson Edge kits, Sensors, Robots) to ensure accuracy in descriptions and use cases.
-   **Best Practices**: Investigation of best practices for implementing robotic systems and AI components, particularly concerning code examples and architectural patterns.

All findings will be incorporated directly into the relevant chapter content and cited according to the APA citation style outlined in the project's Constitution.
